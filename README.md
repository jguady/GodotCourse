# Overview
This is a Godot 4 Course I completed by following @Firebelly Udemy 2D Arena Survivors Course. 

## GDScript
One of the many things that I learned in this course is use of GDScript. GDScript is a custom programming language for the Godot Engine which is very similar to Python3 in many ways.
